# AI-Robotic-Arm-Project

This repository contains the implementation of an AI Robotic Arm project that utilizes neural networks for controlling the arm's movements. The project aims to create an intelligent robotic arm capable of performing various tasks by learning from labeled data using neural networks. The implementation includes Arduino coding for interfacing with the robotic arm hardware and CPP/HPP files for neural network training and control.

Features:
- Neural network-based control: The robotic arm is controlled using a neural network, which is trained on labeled data to learn the desired movements and actions.
- Training data collection: The project includes functionality to collect training data by manually controlling the robotic arm and recording the corresponding movements.
- Data preprocessing: The collected training data is preprocessed and transformed into a format suitable for training the neural network.
- Neural network training: The preprocessed training data is used to train the neural network, enabling it to learn the patterns and relationships between inputs and desired outputs.
- Real-time control: Once trained, the neural network can be deployed to control the robotic arm in real-time, allowing it to perform tasks autonomously based on the learned movements.
